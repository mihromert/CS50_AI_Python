Minimax:

winning condition = -1 and 1
minimizing side = trying to get the lowest score.
maximizer side = trying to get the highest score.

we have:
S0 = initial state
players = a function that gives X or O
actions = a function that returns all the legal move in the state
result = a function that returns a new state that resulted from action a and state s (a,s are inputs..)
terminals = a function that checks whether this is the last step in the game, tie or someone won
returns True if the game has ended, False otherwise.
utility = a function that returns the utility value of the state : -1,0 or 1
